# FM Genius Scout

#### An expansion on [FM Genie Scout](https://www.fmscout.com/a-fm-genie-scout-18.html) This piece of code is for the data analysts/FM lovers.

## Introduction

In Football Manager, one of the most important things is finding good players. Using the in-game scouts is more "traditional", but for data analysts and min/maxers that's not enough. FM Genie Scout allows players to view an actual spreadsheet of all player data, allowing a much finer granularity for picking up key players.

This piece of work takes it a step further. By exporting all the players from FM Genie Scout to .CSV and cleaning it up, we can perform some basic analysis. While FM Genie Scout allows some basic filtering, this analysis allows us to find undervalued players more quickly. By pre-baking in some basic requirements, we can save time setting filters in FM Genie Scout and instead re-run the analysis.


## Shortfalls

The major downside, however, is getting the names of players back into Football Manager. Currently you have to get your list of players - preferably in Excel - then go back into FM Genie Scout or FM and add them to a shortlist.
